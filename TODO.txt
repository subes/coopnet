This Branch is used to increase the quaility of the VoiceChat feature before merging it back into trunk.

Todo includes:

-- high priority --
- use audio compression to lower the bandwidth usage (mp4? if not ogg... look at JMF transcoding)
- implement a noise reduction algorithm -- JMF plugins?

-- low priority --
- switch to UDP -- see JMF with RTP/RTCP
- set playback volume for each person locally (boost/lower volume, range 10% to 600%)

(20:06:41) subes: hi
(20:07:21) subes: i got some more information regarding our voice feature
(20:09:12) subes: we should really read up on jmf (java media framework)
it supports processing plugins like silence suppression and so on (maybe even noise reduction?) gotta see, maybe search online for more plugins
it also supports media streaming via rtp/rtcp -> specially designed for media streaming. drops unnecessary stuff and should increase quality a lot
(20:09:33) subes: also the compression is directly supported by jmf
(20:09:55) subes: so if we get into this, we should get into jmf ;)
(20:13:09) subes: RTP uses UDP :D
(20:13:28) subes: rtp = Real-Time Transport Protocol
(20:13:37) subes: and RTCP = Real-Time Control Protocol
(20:14:52) subes: we currently use JavaSound right?

(20:15:23) subes: Audio-GSM is recommended for audio streaming
