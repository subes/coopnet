This Branch is used to increase the quaility of the VoiceChat feature before merging it back into trunk.

Todo includes:

-- high priority --
- use audio compression to lower the bandwidth usage (mp4? if not ogg... look at JMF transcoding)
- implement a noise reduction algorithm

-- low priority --
- switch to UDP
- set playback volume for each person locally (boost/lower volume, range 10% to 600%)
