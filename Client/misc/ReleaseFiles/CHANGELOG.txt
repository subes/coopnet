    This will solve any connection problems with games, you only have to
    join a hamachi room (the host and the clients having connection problems must be connected aswell) and check the "hamachi support" checkbox.
    Note that it needs time to change to the hamachi interface, about 5-10 seconds.
    Not everyone needs to be in the hamachi room, only the host and the people who want to use that feature.
    The others should NOT check in the checkbox or they will be unable to connect.
