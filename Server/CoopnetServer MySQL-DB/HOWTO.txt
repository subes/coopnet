The scripts in this folder are developed for MySQL and tested in MySQL 5.0.

To create all the stuff CoopnetServer needs, run the following scripts in the exact order:

- Log in as the MySQL administrator ...
1. createUserAndDatabase.sql
- From here on you could switch to using the new coopnet user, or just keep running these as administrator ...
2. createTables.sql
3. createTriggers.sql
4. createProcedures.sql

If you deploy this database for a deployment server, you should aswell set up a cron job, that runs the script "deleteInactiveUsers.sql" periodically. Once a month to up to once a year should be enough.
