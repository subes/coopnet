<h2>2.Selecting channel </h2>
<p>Games are associated with channels, each game has a channel where you can chat and play. <br>
  To select a channel use the &quot;Channel List&quot; item in &quot;Channels&quot; menu : </p>
<p><img src="guidepics/channels.jpg" width="377" height="131"></p>
<p>A new window will appear, it shows all available channels: </p>
<p><img src="guidepics/channellist.jpg" width="359" height="394"></p>
<p>Doubleclick the game you want to play!<br>
The window will dissapear and the games channel will appear:</p>
<p><img src="guidepics/gamechannel.jpg" width="596" height="398"></p>
<p>At the bottom half is the chat. Type in the bottom textfield and press enter to send messages.<br>
On the list on the right you can see the players in the channel.<br>
The upper half is the roomlist.</p>
<h2>3. Creating/Joining rooms: </h2>
<p>To<strong> join</strong> an already existing room you doubleclick it on the room-list, or select it and press the &quot;Join&quot; button.</p>
<p>To <strong> create</strong> a new room press the &quot;Create&quot; button at the top. A new window will appear:</p>
<p><img src="guidepics/create.jpg" width="471" height="237"></p>
<p>Here you must specify a name  for the room.<br>
  Optionally you can set a password. When set, only people who know the password will be able to join your room<br>
  Press the &quot;Create&quot; button at the bottom to create the room. <br>
  The room tab will appear and your room will be added in the room list in the channel:
</p>
<p><img src="guidepics/roomlist.jpg" width="598" height="398"></p>
<h2>4. In the room: </h2>
<p>A room looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="guidepics/room.jpg" width="599" height="399"></p>
<p>On the top there are some buttons, the rest is a chat similar to the channel chat.<br>
  The Ready button is to show the others you are ready to play. <br>
  Who does not ready up cannot play.<br>
  The player list on the right side shows the player status in color code:<br>
  -red means not ready<br>
  -green means ready<br>
  -yellow means the player is playing the game</p>
<p>The host has a Launch button that will start the game<br>
  and everyone who was ready will be launched into the game. <br>
  On the top right is the close/leave button. <br>
  This makes you leave the room and the room tab will dissapear.<br> 
  If you are the host the room will be closed, everyone in it will leave it and it will be removed from the room list.</p>
<p>Joiners also have a &quot;Use Hamachi&quot; checkbox.<br>
   This enables players with network issues to play the game<br>
   but it is  <strong>NOT recommended</strong> otherwise.<br>
   It will try to connect trough hamachi, so this only works if <br>
   both you and the host are connected to the same Hamachi network!</p>
<p>For more explanation see the manual! </p>
